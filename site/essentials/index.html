			<h2>What are web components?</h2>
			<p>
				"Web components" is a loose term used to reference a set of evolving browser APIs and
				technologies that can be used to create custom HTML elements.
			</p>
			<p>
				Restated more clearly: <em>Web components are HTML elements</em>. From the browsers
				perspective, a web component is just as much an HTML element as a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or
				<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element.
			</p>
			<p>
				The implications of this are extremely important. Web components do not follow the same
				rules, conventions, and mental models of a "component" you might find in React, Svelte, or
				Vue. Instead they follow the rules, conventions, and mental models of HTML elements.
			</p>
			<h2>Why would I want to use web components?</h2>
			<p>
				Since web components are HTML elements they represent a browser native way of creating
				reusable UI that can be used
				<a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/">just about</a> anywhere you can write
				HTML.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the big motivations of web components is the idea that you can build a set of UI
				elements that can be used again and again in your projects even if the underlying web
				framework or technology stack you use changes over time.
			</p>
			<section class="info-banner">
				<p>
					React is the one notable exception in 2024. Native support for web components is available
					in the current @beta release, but has not yet been formally released in a stable version.
					Despite this, there are still ways to use web components in older versions of React.
				</p>
			</section>
			<h2>Will web components replace my web framework?</h2>
			<p>No. In an ideal world they should work together.</p>
			<p>
				At its core, web components only provide a way of grouping reusable chunks of UI and
				behavior. As of 2024, they provide no APIs for routing, reactive data, templating syntax,
				and so on, like you might find in a modern web framework.
			</p>
			<section class="info-banner">
				<p>
					If you would like to build your web components with some of these ergonomic improvements
					you’ll want to look into web component frameworks/compilers (discussed below).
				</p>
			</section>
			<h2>When should I use web components?</h2>
			<p>The answer can vary a bit depending on who you ask.</p>
			<p>
				One of the most prominent use cases is to build web framework independent design systems and
				component libraries. Check out <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace</a> as a great
				example of a very mature web component library.
			</p>
			<p>
				Others like to selectively build and use web components to serve as
				<a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">islands of interactivity</a> within
				static web pages. Fun fact: Web components are so well suited to the islands architecture
				it’s how the Astro web framework
				<a
					href="https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/src/runtime/server/astro-island.ts"
				>
					implements their islands architecture</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				And others, still, choose to build entire applications using web components. For example,
				see
				<a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web#web-components-and-lit">Photoshop</a>,
				<a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> (inspect code),
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> (inspect code),
				<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/05/28/an-even-faster-microsoft-edge/">
					Microsoft Edge</a
				>, and <a href="https://briangrinstead.com/blog/firefox-webcomponents/">Firefox</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>Who uses web components?</h2>
			<p>A <em>lot</em> of people and organizations.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adobe</li>
				<li>Amazon</li>
				<li>Apple</li>
				<li>Firefox</li>
				<li>GitHub</li>
				<li>Google</li>
				<li>Microsoft</li>
				<li>NASA</li>
				<li>Reddit</li>
				<li>Salesforce</li>
				<li>SpaceX</li>
				<li>Stripe</li>
				<li>YouTube</li>
				<li><a href="https://arewebcomponentsathingyet.com/">Even more companies/projects</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What does a web component look like?</h2>
			<p>
				From the perspective of a web component consumer, they look like HTML elements with some
				special differences. Specifically, to avoid naming collisions with regular HTML elements,
				all custom elements must follow a few rules:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Starts with a lowercase ASCII character</li>
				<li>Contains at least one hyphen</li>
				<li>Does not contain uppercase ASCII characters</li>
				<li>
					Does not contain some special characters as defined by
					<a
						href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name"
						>the spec</a
					>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For example, these would be valid web components:</p>
			<pre styled><code>&lt;<span>my-component</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>my-component</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>my-other-component</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>my-other-component</span>&gt;
<span data-comment>// Even this is valid (although maybe not recommended)</span>
&lt;<span>c-</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>c-</span>&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>And these would be invalid web components:</p>
			<pre styled><code>&lt;<span>MyComponent</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>MyComponent</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>my_component</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>my_component</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>mycomponent</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>mycomponent</span>&gt;</code></pre>
			<section class="info-banner">
				<p>
					For even more information and discussion on what web components can look like, Jim Nielsen
					has written some

						>great</a
					>
					<a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/custom-elements-only-need-end-with-a-hyphen/"
						>articles</a
					>
					on the topic.
				</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				From the perspective of a web component author, they look like JavaScript classes that
				extend the native <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://javascript.info/custom-elements">Custom Elements API</a> is the
				JavaScript API responsible for making this happen. It is the absolute bare minimum you need
				to build a web component. Here's an example:
			</p>
			<pre
				styled
			><code><span>class</span> <span data-class>MyComponent</span> <span>extends</span> <span data-class>HTMLElement</span> {
	<span>constructor</span>() {
		<span>super</span>();
	}
}
<span data-highlight>customElements</span>.<span data-fn>define</span>(<span data-string>'my-component'</span>, <span data-class>MyComponent</span>);</code></pre>
			<p>
				This web component renders nothing and has no functionality. But it <em>is</em> a web
				component. It <em>is</em> an HTML element.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond registering custom HTML elements with the browser, the Custom Elements API also
				provides several component
				<a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements#custom_element_lifecycle_callbacks"
					>lifecycle methods</a
				>
				that let you define custom behavior when a component is:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added to a page</li>
				<li>Removed from a page</li>
				<li>Moved to a new page</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				There is also a lifecycle method for when a component attribute has been changed, added,
				removed, or replaced.
			</p>
			<section class="info-banner">
				<p>
					It's also worth mentioning the
					<a href="https://javascript.info/shadow-dom">Shadow DOM API</a> and HTML
					<a href="https://javascript.info/template-element"
						><code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element</a
					>, which are commonly used when authoring web components.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Shadow DOM API is a JavaScript API that is primarily used for creating scoped styles
					and component slots, while the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element is used to define and
					store the markup of a web component.
				</p>
				<p>These and other web component APIs are discussed more below.</p>
			</section>
			<h2>How do you architect a web component?</h2>
			<p>
				There are two major ways of architecting a web component. These two methods are commonly
				referred to as “HTML Web Components” and “JavaScript Web Components.”
			</p>
			<p>
				HTML Web Components are perhaps the simpler and more flexible way of building web
				components. The core premise of HTML Web Components is to write plain HTML and then wrap the
				parts you want to be interactive using a custom element.
			</p>
			<p>
				These components only use the Custom Elements API and do not use any other APIs you might
				find in the “web components” bucket. They look like this:
			</p>
			<pre styled><code>&lt;<span>counter-button</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span>button</span>&gt;Clicked &lt;<span>span</span>&gt;<span data-base>0</span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt; times&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>counter-button</span>&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>In other words, an HTML Web Component will hydrate/progressively enhance existing HTML.</p>
			<p>
				JavaScript Web Components, on the other hand, are historically what most people would think
				of as “regular” web components. They use a wider variety of web component APIs, such as
				Shadow DOM or templates. They look like this:
			</p>
			<pre
				styled
			><code>&lt;<span>counter-button</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>counter-button</span>&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				In other words, JavaScript Web Component will dynamically generate UI at runtime, similar to
				single-page application (SPA) components.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are benefits and drawbacks to both models, so it’s usually a case of picking the right
				tool (read: architecture) for the right job.

			<h2>What other APIs make up web components?</h2>
			<p>
				The Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and template APIs are only three of an ever-evolving set of
				APIs that can be used to build web components. There are several fantastic resources to
				learn more about other web component APIs that are currently available, being worked on, and
				proposed for the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				See the
				<a href="https://eisenbergeffect.medium.com/2023-state-of-web-components-c8feb21d4f16">
					2023 State of Web Components
				</a>
				by Rob Eisenberg (a prominent contributor to the web component space). It's the most recent
				and comprehensive overview of web component APIs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also check out the yearly reports from
				<a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents-cg/">Web Component Community Group</a>, which
				include the web component APIs that have been proposed to browser vendors for
				implementation.

			</ul>
			<h2>How do new web component APIs get added?</h2>
			<p>
				Just like any other browser API, new web component APIs must go through their own standards
				process.
			</p>
			<p>
				A combination of various <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents-cg/">community</a>
				<a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents">groups</a> and browser vendor teams are
				continuously working together to propose new APIs, specify and standarize how they should
				work, and then get them implemented across browsers.
			</p>
			<p>This. process. takes. time.</p>
			<section class="info-banner">
				<p>
					Historical context: This is the reason that web components, despite being introduced back
					in the early 2010s, have taken so long to really increase in adoption. It took almost a
					decade to get the first set of web component APIs standarized and implemented across all
					major browsers.
				</p>
			</section>
			<p>
				Lucky for us, this process is starting to move quicker. Efforts like
				<a href="https://web.dev/blog/interop-2022">Interop 2022</a>,
				<a href="https://web.dev/blog/interop-2023">Interop 2023</a>, and
				<a href="https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024">Interop 2024</a> have meant all major browser
				vendors are working together to solve browser compatibility issues and is hinting at a new
				reality where these vendors are committing to be better about implementing new and existing
				APIs in a timely and consistent way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even with a quicker feedback loop, however, new web component features will (for the most
				part) always take longer to ship than new web framework features.
			</p>
			<p>
				This can often be frustrating to some people, but there is an important tradeoff being made.
				The upfront cost of standards work means that any API added to browsers is committing to be
				backwards compatible. Once a web component API is added, it's here to stay.
			</p>
			<p>
				The end result is that
				<a
					href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-will-outlive-your-javascript-framework/"
					>web components should outlast entire web frameworks</a
				>.
			</p>
			<h2>What are web component frameworks and should I use them?</h2>
			<p>
				Web component frameworks are opinionated abstractions on top of the lower level browser APIs
				that have been mentioned above. They usually provide enhancements such as improved
				templating, reactive data, declarative syntax, and other general improvements to the
				experience of building web components.
			</p>
			<p>You very likely want to use a web component framework when building web components.</p>

				check out are:

				Solid, Preact, and Vue) have the ability to export their components as standalone web
				components.
